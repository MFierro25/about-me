                    <h2> Who Is Joey Anyway?</h2>
                    <p>Hello fellow travelers, my name is Joseph Hernandez but I go by either "Joey" or "Joe," choose your own adventure when it comes to that decision because I will respond to either. </p>
                    <h2> My Education </h2>
                    <p> So I am a jack of all trades, master of none. I have a degree in Art, I started my degree in Mechanical Engineering but dropped out with a little over a year to go and now here I am at Codefellows on a whole new trajectory! I am both excited and terrified with this choice, but here I am, story of my life.</p>
                    <h2> My Work History </h2>
                    <p>My very first job was at the Magic Kingdom in Anaheim, yes Disneyland. From there I waited tables at a fine establishment known as "Islands." Then I embarked on a crazy ride for 14 years when I joined the U.S. Navy. It was both the best decision and the worst one all wrapped into one, but I wouldn't change a thing.</p>
                    <p>Once I got out of the military, I worked at Starbucks for a bit, then I discovered the incredible Seattle Beer Industry, where I am currently and am a professional brewer of Beer. I have brewed every style you can imagine from Farmhouse ales to Pilsners and IPA's. I absolutely adore the beer industry and am so thankful for everythng I have learned and one day, maybe I will open my own small brewery.</p>
