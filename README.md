# All About Me 

Hello fellow travelers, my name is Joseph Hernandez but I go by either "Joey" or "Joe," choose your own adventure when it comes to that decision because I will respond to either. 

## Education stats

So I am a jack of all trades, master of none. I have a degree in Art, I started my degree in Mechanical Engineering but dropped out with a little over a year to go and now here I am at Codefellows on a whole new trajectory! I am both excited and terrified with this choice, but here I am, story of my life. 

## Job Experience

My very first job was at the Magic Kingdom in Anaheim, yes Disneyland. From there I waited tables at a fine establishment known as "Islands." Then I embarked on a crazy ride for 14 years when I joined the U.S. Navy. It was both the best decision and the worst one all wrapped into one, but I wouldn't change a thing. 

Once I got out of the military, I worked at Starbucks for a bit, then I discovered the incredible Seattle Beer Industry, where I am currently and am a professional brewer of Beer. I have brewed every style you can imagine from Farmhouse ales to Pilsners and IPA's. I absolutely adore the beer industry and am so thankful for everythng I have learned and one day, maybe I will open my own small brewery.

## My Goals

Honestly, my biggest goal in front of me is to complete this course to the best of my ability. I absolutely want to see this to its end. That's my biggest goal at the moment.

Standing goals (constantly works in progress) I want to master becoming a true software development engineer, I want to be the best Father and Husband I can be, and I ultimately would love to do something with my life that makes a difference, what that will be? I have no idea, but I am ALWAYS interested in growing, learning, and improving.
