# All About Me 

Hello fellow travelers, my name is Joseph Hernandez but I go by either "Joey" or "Joe," choose your own adventure when it comes to that decision because I will respond to either. 

## Education stats

So I am a jack of all trades, master of none. I have a degree in Art, I started my degree in Mechanical Engineering but dropped out with a little over a year to go and now here I am at Codefellows on a whole new trajectory! I am both excited and terrified with this choice, but here I am, story of my life. 

## Job Experience

My very first job was at the Magic Kingdom in Anaheim, yes Disneyland. From there I waited tables at a fine establishment known as "Islands." Then I embarked on a crazy ride for 14 years when I joined the U.S. Navy. It was both the best decision and the worst one all wrapped into one, but I wouldn't change a thing. 

Once I got out of the military, I worked at Starbucks for a bit, then I discovered the incredible Seattle Beer Industry, where I am currently and am a professional brewer of Beer. I have brewed every style you can imagine from Farmhouse ales to Pilsners and IPA's. I absolutely adore the beer industry and am so thankful for everythng I have learned and one day, maybe I will open my own small brewery.

## My Goals

Honestly, my biggest goal in front of me is to complete this course to the best of my ability. I absolutely want to see this to its end. That's my biggest goal at the moment.

Standing goals (constantly works in progress) I want to master becoming a true software development engineer, I want to be the best Father and Husband I can be, and I ultimately would love to do something with my life that makes a difference, what that will be? I have no idea, but I am ALWAYS interested in growing, learning, and improving.

# Expanding the game

1. As a user, I would like to view a series of data related to the site owners interest so that the I can quickly view more information about them.
Create a “Top Ten” at the bottom of your HTML page as an ordered list in HTML. Some ideas that you can include could be top ten movies, top ten favorite places, or top ten places to visit. You may choose to do whatever top ten list that you wish.
Convert your work experience and education summary into an unordered list using HTML

2. As a user, I would like to be guided to an answer through a series of feedback responses so that I can learn more about the site owner.

* Add a 6th question to the guessing game that takes in a numeric input by prompting the user to guess a number.Indicates through an alert if the guess is “too high” or “too low”.
It should give the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer.

* After all attempts have been exhausted, tell the user the correct answer. Consider using a loop of some sort.

3. As a user, I would like to guess the answer to a question that could have many possibilities so that I can have fun with with a guessing game.

* Add a 7th question that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array.
Give the user 6 attempts to guess the correct answer.

* The guesses will end once the user guesses a correct answer or they run out of attempts.
Display all the possible correct answers to the user.
Consider using a loop of some sort for this question.

4. As a user, I would like to know my final score so that I can know how well I did.
Keep track of the total number of correct answers. At the end tell them how many they got correct out of the 7 questions asked.
